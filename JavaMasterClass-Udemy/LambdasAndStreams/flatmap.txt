************************FLATMAP******************************************************
-> We may want to transform an Object in more than one Object
-> The method accepts a function that returns a stream value

--> FLATMAP because it's often used to flatten nested lists.

--> COLLECT is a terminal opertion and collects the steam's elements into another kind of result

--> REDUCE --> Accepts to arguments and returns one.

-> STREAMS ARE LAZILY EVALUATED -> Nothing is executed unless a terminal operation is found.
