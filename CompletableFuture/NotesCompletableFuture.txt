CompletableFuture is used for asynchronous programming in Java. Asynchronous programming is a means of writing non-blocking code by running a task on a separate thread than the main application thread and notifying the main thread about its progress, completion or failure.

This way, your main thread does not block/wait for the completion of the task and it can execute other tasks in parallel.

Having this kind of parallelism greatly improves the performance of your programs.

***********************************************************************************************
Limitations of the Future
A Future cannot be mutually complete.
We cannot perform further action on a Future's result without blocking.
Future has not any exception handling.
We cannot combine multiple futures.
